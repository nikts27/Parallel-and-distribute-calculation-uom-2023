Parallel & Distributed Computing Exercises
This repository contains the solutions for the laboratory exercises of the "Parallel and Distributed Computing" course.
⦁	Institution: University of Macedonia (UoM)
⦁	Department: Applied Informatics
⦁	Academic Year: 2023-2024

📝 Description
The purpose of this repository is to archive and present the solutions developed during the course's laboratory sessions. The exercises were implemented in Python and cover a wide range of topics, from basic parallelism with threads and processes to complex synchronization problems, distributed algorithms, and network programming (sockets, RMI).
📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders, where each folder corresponds to a laboratory session (Lab).
