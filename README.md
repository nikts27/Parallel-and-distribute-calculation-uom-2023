Parallel & Distributed Computing Exercises
==========================================

This repository contains the solutions for the laboratory exercises of the "Parallel and Distributed Computing" course.

*   **Institution:** University of Macedonia (UoM)
    
*   **Department:** Applied Informatics
    
*   **Academic Year:** 2023-2024
    

üìù Description
--------------

The purpose of this repository is to archive and present the solutions developed during the course's laboratory sessions. The exercises were implemented in **Python** and cover a wide range of topics, from basic parallelism with threads and processes to complex synchronization problems, distributed algorithms, and network programming (sockets, RMI).

üìÇ Repository Structure
-----------------------

The repository is organized into folders, where each folder corresponds to a laboratory session (Lab).
